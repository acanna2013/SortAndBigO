# Background
I was introduced to sorting algorithms and Big-O notation in a course offered at my high school. 
These are the courses I took:

A(Intro to Programming) --> B(AP Computer Science A) --> C(AP Computer Science Principles) --> D(Advanced Topics in Programming)
```
<paragraph> This repo includes severals projects I worked on using what I learned.

## What I Learned
I learned about the most popular sorting algorithms
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* ... <br>
I also created my own sorting algorithm, where we adopted the idea of selection sort and sorted according to the maximum value instead of the minimum value.
